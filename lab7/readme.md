    Introduction to NetSim network simulator and procedure of working in it
    Simulate a three node point-to-point network with the links connected as follows:
    n0 to n2, n1 to n2 and n2 to n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. 
    Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP / UDP. (n0, n1 and n3 are nodes and n2 is router.).
