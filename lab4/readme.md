    Simulate a two node point-to-point network with a duplex link between them add trace file to the same (use this file - firsttr.tcl in this link) write an awk script to count the number of packets
    For the three nodes in the earlier class, Set queue size to 3 and vary the bandwith (two cases) and count the packets being dropped
    Simulate a four-node point-to-point network and connect the link as follows: Apply TCP agent between n0 and n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP. Change bandwidth and latency (two cases) and determine the number of packets sent by two agents 

Constraint: In all the above cases, no node or link should be kept inactive at any instant of time
