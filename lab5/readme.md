Generate netwok as shown here (below)

Assign cost between 0 & 1 as 5 and 5 & 4 as 3

    simulate Distance Vector Routing protocol

    Deduce relevent infrence from your observation(s) and write appropriate conclusions
    Repeat the above for Link State Routing protocol awk script to count the number of packets 

make link 2-3 go down at 2.0 and link 1-4 at 2.8

make link 1-4 up at 3.0 and 2-3 at 3.5

make link 2-3 and 2-4 go down at 4.0

stop simulation at 4.5 or 5
