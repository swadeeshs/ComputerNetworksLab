3. Simulate a three node point-to-point network with a duplex link between them for the following cases:

    a. One node apiece acts as the sender and receiver and the remaining nodes acts as a repeater
    b. One node acts as the sender and two nodes acts receiver and data should flow in two diffent directions
    c. Two nodes acts as sender and one node acts as receiver. Set queue size to 3 and vary the bandwith (two cases) and count the packets being dropped 

NOTE: Use TCP as transport layer protocol and FTP as traffic source for all cases

Constraint: In all the above cases, no node or link should be kept inactive at any instant of time
